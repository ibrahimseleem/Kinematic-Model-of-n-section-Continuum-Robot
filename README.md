# Kinematic-Model-of-n-section-Continuum-Robot

The following function can compute the approximate kinematic model of n-section continuum robot based on the following articles

The exact kinematic model of [1] suffers from singularity if the robotic arm in straight configuration. Taylor expansion series were applied to overcome the singularity.
please if you will use this code, cite the aforementioned paper from [1] to [4] to keep the author rights
